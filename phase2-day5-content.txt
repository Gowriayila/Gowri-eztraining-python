TYPES OF TREES:
-binary tree:node can have maximun 2 child

BINARY TREE TRAVERSAL:

-inorder:left-root-right    LDR
-preorder:root-left-right   DLR
-postorder:left,right,root  LRD

TYPES OF BINARY TREE:
-full binary tree:all nodes will have zero or 2 child.
-degenerate tree:every node will have zero or 1 child.
-skewed binary tree:
        a                      a
       /                        \
      b                          b
     /                            \
    c                              c
 left skew binary tree          right skew binary tree

TYPES BASED ON COMPLETION:

-complete binary tree
 1. every level should be full
 2.in last level if it is incomplte nodes should ne present at extreme left side

        12
       /  \
      8    18
     / \
    5   11

-perfect binary tree:
 all internal nodes those who have 2 childern and a leaf nodes both should be at same level
 
                   18
                  /  \
                15    30
               /  \   /  \
              40  50 100 40

-balanced binary tree:
  for all the nodes height of left subtree-height of right subtree can be 0 or 1.
           0(d=0)                          0(d=2)
          / \                             / \
    (d=0)1   2(d=0)                (d=1) 1   2(d=0)
        / \                             / \
  (d=0)3   4(d=0)                 (d=1)3   4(d=0)
                                      /
                                     5(d=0)
 
  BALANCED                         UNBALANCED

BINARY SEARCH TREE:
 1.all the left side elements should be lesser than its parent 
 2.all the right side element should be greater than it parent
              7
            /  \
           3    10
         /   \    \
        2     5    12
